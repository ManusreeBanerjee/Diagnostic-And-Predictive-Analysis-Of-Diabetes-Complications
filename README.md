# Diagnostic-And-Predictive-Analysis-Of-Diabetes-Complications
Problem statement
The objective of my project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

A study was done “Diagnosis and predictive clinical and para-clinical cutoffs for diabetes complications in Lur and Lak populations of Iran; a ROC curve analysis to design a regional guideline”. I have used their data to compute the statistical significance of co-factors such age, sex, body mass index, hypertension etc. on health conditions such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Check for presence of multicollinearity and perform normality tests. Finally perform a regression analysis to predict diabetes.
